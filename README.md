# Exam

## Start your exam

- Run `npm install`
- Start the SASS compiler and browser-sync with the command `gulp` or `npm run watch`

## Upload exam to Canvas (when your exam is finished!)

- Open _gulpfile.js_
- Replace, on line 2, the value for the variable `name` with your class, surname and name: e.g. `1IT01_Doe_John`
- Run the command `gulp zip` or `npm run zip`
  (a file _1ITF01_Doe_John.zip_ is created at the root of your project)
- **Check if this _.zip_-file contains all the (non-hidden) files from this project, except the _node_modules_ folder!**
- Upload the file _1ITF01_Doe_John.zip_ to Canvas

## IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE YOU START YOUR EXAM!

- If you can't copy sourcecode from Chrome, use Firefox or Edge instead (Proctorio sometimes blocks copy/paste in Chrome)
- You're not allowed to use any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to solve the exam
- All activities are monitored and recorded with Proctorio and AI cheating detection (cheating is exam fraud!)
- Do not wait until the last few minutes to create the ZIP file because there is a chance that you will
  not be able to upload your exam on time!
- No upload is **0/20** for your exam!
